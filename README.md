This is a fork of Zend Framework 1 that we'll maintain as long as we're using it, mainly just to keep it working on new versions of PHP as they're released.

This fork is based on the final release of the original project (version 1.12.20), and releases will follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The first release of this fork is version 2.0.0.

Installation via composer is the suggested way to install this fork:

`composer require fragotesac/zf1`

## Release Highlights

### 5.0.0

-   Removed phpunit/dbunit from Zend_Test component, as this has been abandoned and made it difficult to upgrade to newer versions of phpunit (which makes it difficult to test against newer versions of PHP)
-   Fixed some function signatures in these classes to move required parameters before parameters with defaults (this behavior is deprecated in PHP 8 and will throw errors in a later version of PHP):
    -   Zend_Pdf_Element_Reference
    -   Zend_Service_WindowsAzure_CommandLine_Certificate::getCertificatePropertyCommand
    -   Zend_Service_WindowsAzure_CommandLine_Deployment::createFromStorageCommand & createFromLocalCommand
    -   Zend_Service_WindowsAzure_Diagnostics_Manager::setConfigurationForRoleInstance
    -   Zend_Service_WindowsAzure_Storage_Queue::deleteMessage
-   All packages, and the remaining components in this repo have been tested against PHP 8 (both with phpunit and phpstan). For the most part this didn't require any code changes, and what was changed shouldn't break BC except what's listed above.

### 4.0.0

-   Moved a majority of components to their own separate composer package. This package can still be used like before (if being installed with composer, if not, you'll need to stick to the 3.x line), as it pulls in all of the separate components via composer, but it's recommended to just use the components you need. View this project's `composer.json` to see which components are available as a separate package.
-   Removed sqlite cache classes from Zend_Cache (in the `diablomedia/zendframework1-cache` package) since they're not compatible with PHP 7.0+
-   Autoloading namespaces changed to be more specific, which should speed up non-optimized autoloaders a bit.

### 3.0.0

-   Minimum PHP version set to 7.0
-   PHPUnit upgraded to 6.0

### 2.0.0

-   Renamed to our organization in Composer
-   Minimum PHP version set to 5.6

# RELEASE INFORMATION

Zend Framework 1.12.21dev Release.
Released on MMM DD, YYYY.

## IMPORTANT FIXES FOR 1.12.21

See http://framework.zend.com/changelog for full details.

# NEW FEATURES

## Zend_Loader changes

A number of autoloaders and autoloader facilities were back ported from
ZF2 to provide performant alternatives to those already available in the
1.X releases. These include: Zend_Loader_StandardAutoloader, which
improves on Zend_Loader_Autoloader by allowing the ability to specify a
specific path to associate with a vendor prefix or namespace;
Zend_Loader_ClassMapAutoloader, which provides the ability to use lookup
tables for autoloading (which are typically the fastest possible way to
autoload); and Zend_Loader_AutoloaderFactory, which can both create and
update autoloaders for you, as well as register them with
spl_autoload_register().

The Zend_Loader changes were back ported from ZF2 by Matthew Weier
O’Phinney

## Zend_EventManager

Zend_EventManager is a component that allows you to attach and detach
listeners to named events, both on a per-instance basis as well as via
shared collections; trigger events; and interrupt execution of
listeners.

Zend_EventManager was back ported from ZF2 by Matthew Weier O’Phinney

## Zend_Http_UserAgent_Features_Adapter_Browscap

This class provides a features adapter that calls get_browser() in order
to discover mobile device capabilities to inject into UserAgent device
instances.

Browscap (http://browsers.garykeith.com/) is an open project dedicated
to collecting an disseminating a “database” of browser capabilities. PHP
has built-in support for using these files via the get_browser()
function. This function requires that your php.ini provides a browscap
entry pointing to the PHP-specific php_browscap.ini file which is
available at http://browsers.garykeith.com/stream.asp?PHP_BrowsCapINI.

Zend_Http_UserAgent_Features_Adapter_Browscap was created by Matthew
Weier O’Phinney

## Zend_Mobile_Push

Zend_Mobile_Push is a component for implementing push notifications for
the 3 major push notification platforms (Apple (Apns), Google (C2dm) and
Microsoft (Mpns).

Zend_Mobile_Push was contributed by Mike Willbanks.

## Zend_Gdata_Analytics

Zend_Gdata_Analytics is an extension to Zend_Gdata to allow interaction
with Google’s Analytics Data Export API. This extension does not
encompass any major changes in the overall operation of Zend_Gdata
components.

Zend_Gdata_Analytics was contributed by Daniel Hartmann.

# Removed features

## Zend_Http_UserAgent_Features_Adapter_WurflApi

Due to the changes in licensing of WURFL, we have removed the WurflApi
adapter. We will be providing the WurflApi adapter to ScientiaMobile so
that users of WURFL will still have that option.

# Bug Fixes

In addition, over 200 reported issues in the tracker have been fixed.
We’d like to particularly thank Adam Lundrigan, Frank Brückner and
Martin Hujer for their efforts in making this happen. Thanks also to the
many people who ran the ZF1 unit tests and reported their results!
